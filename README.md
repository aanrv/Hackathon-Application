# Social_Media_Application

An unnamed application written at the Lehman College NSBE Fall 2015 Hackathon.

Hackathon Themes Followed:
1. A medium to shed light on accounts of social injustice.
2. A social media convenience tool.

The application is centered around exposing and providing support for social injustices (where the law may have been unable to) through the extensive reach of various social medias and the support of the internet (which obviously consists of only the best and brightest that humanity has to offer).
The subtleties of the application's idea still require to be expanded upon, so the implementation is incomplete.
